# Geometric Sunset v1

This piece explores the tension between rigid geometric forms and the soft, organic quality of natural light. I wanted to capture that magical moment when late afternoon sun creates geometric shadows through architectural elements.

## Concept Development

The idea started with an observation: how venetian blinds transform sunlight into precise strips of warm and cool color. There's something beautiful about this intersection of human-made geometry and natural phenomena.

In code, I translated this into a series of overlapping rectangles with carefully controlled color relationships and subtle position variations.

## Technical Implementation

```javascript
function generateSunset() {
  const layers = [];
  const baseHue = 25; // Warm orange starting point
  
  for (let i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
    const layer = {
      x: noise(i * 0.1) * 50 - 25,
      y: i * 15,
      width: width + 100,
      height: 20 + noise(i * 0.05) * 10,
      hue: baseHue + noise(i * 0.02) * 40,
      saturation: 60 + noise(i * 0.03) * 20,
      brightness: 90 - i * 1.5,
      alpha: 0.3 + noise(i * 0.01) * 0.2
    };
    layers.push(layer);
  }
  
  return layers;
}
```

## Color Philosophy

The color palette is built around the golden hour spectrum - warm oranges and yellows in the foreground gradually cooling to deeper purples and blues in the background. Each layer has slight variations in hue and saturation, controlled by Perlin noise to maintain coherence while adding organic variation.

The transparency and layering create depth, with overlapping areas producing unexpected color mixtures that mirror how light actually behaves in physical space.

## Process Notes

What surprised me was how much the subtle position variations mattered. Perfectly aligned rectangles felt sterile and digital. The slight horizontal shifts, controlled by noise functions, give the piece a more hand-crafted feeling despite being entirely algorithmic.

I also learned that the alpha blending mode dramatically affects the final mood. Multiply blending creates richer, more saturated overlaps that feel more like actual light mixing.

## Iteration Plans

This first version establishes the core visual language, but there's so much room for exploration:

- **Animation**: Slowly shifting the color progression to show the full sunset sequence
- **Interaction**: Mouse movement could influence the "wind" affecting the geometric elements  
- **Time-based**: Different palettes for dawn, noon, dusk, night
- **Weather**: Rain, fog, or storm variations of the same geometric approach

## On Generative Art

There's something deeply satisfying about encoding natural phenomena into algorithmic systems. You're not just copying nature, but discovering the underlying mathematical poetry that makes it beautiful.

The random variations keep each generated version unique, yet the underlying rules ensure they all feel part of the same visual family. It's like writing a recipe for beauty and then letting the code cook infinite variations.
