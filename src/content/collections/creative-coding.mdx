# Creative Coding Experiments

Code as a creative medium opens up unique possibilities that traditional art-making tools can't access. These experiments explore generative systems, interactive experiences, and algorithmic aesthetics.

## Philosophy

Creative coding isn't just about making art with code - it's about discovering what kinds of art become possible when you think in systems, loops, and emergence rather than fixed forms.

Each project here starts with a simple rule or constraint and explores what complexity can emerge from that foundation. The goal isn't to replicate what could be made by hand, but to find aesthetics that could only exist in code.

## The Generative Mindset

Working generatively means accepting that you're not fully in control of the final output. You design the system, set the parameters, and then discover what it creates. There's a collaborative relationship between intention and surprise that keeps the work alive and unpredictable.

This collection documents that ongoing dialogue between the designer and the system, capturing both successful explorations and interesting failures.
